# EasyLexi-Decoding-Difficulties-for-Dyslexics
Dyslexia - a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words, 1 in 10 people suffer from dyslexia.
Most of us have heard about Dyslexia, but how many of us have tried to understand the fear, nervousness and confusion that they face on a daily basis, as students, as working professionals, as people ?

EasyLexi is a technological solution designed to help dyslexic people overcome this fear, this anxiety, this confusion by providing them a platform to get more comfortable with words and sounds. It is aimed at decoding the difficulty. In this era of technological solutions, our goal is to achieve equity and solve challenges that people encounter on a daily basis. We hope that with EasyLexi, people with dyslexia can become more familiar and comfortable.

Our true goal  will be achieved when dyslexic people find it more convenient and become more comfortable. 
We aim at providing more features in a customised manner to our users in the future as well as developing mobile applications for the same.
